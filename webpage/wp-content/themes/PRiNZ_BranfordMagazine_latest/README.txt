Credits
=======

Thanks to Darren Hoyt and his "Mimbo" theme which has been a great inspiration
and a good source for lots of the code I used for this theme especially the intensive
use of custom fields.

Thanks to Brian Gardner and "Revolution" which inspired me to put the two additional
page layouts "Featured Page" and "3-Column-Page" into the theme.

Thanks to Patrick Griffiths who delivered the script for the dropdown menues. http://www.htmldog.com/articles/suckerfish/dropdowns/

I´d also like to thank Klaus Hartl (stilbuero.de) for the brilliant script I used 
for the tabbed section with the fade effect.

And last but not least my very special thanks go out to all of you out there
using the theme and sending me tons of emails telling me how great this theme is.

THANK YOU ALL!!!
