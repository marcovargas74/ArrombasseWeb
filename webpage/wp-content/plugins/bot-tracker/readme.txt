Bot Tracker wraps CrawlTrack (http://www.crawltrack.fr/), a php crawler tracker application.

== Description ==

A while ago, I did a plugin for myself to track robots activity on my websites and display them with jpgraph. 
While preparing for a release here, I discovered Crawltrack. So this is a Crawltrack Plugin for WordPress.

== Installation ==

1. Download, unzip and upload to your WordPress plugins directory
2. activate the plugin within you WordPress Administration Backend
3. be patient and wait until Cr@wltr@ck gets some stats, then go to your Dashboard > Bopt Tracker
